# Computer Vision Lab 2  
## Data Visualization with Matplotlib

This repository contains my second practical lab for the **Deep Learning for Computer Vision** course.

The main focus of this lab is building strong foundations in **data visualization using Matplotlib**, which is a critical skill for analyzing data and interpreting results in computer vision and machine learning workflows.
